# teapot

Let your colleagues know when the tea is ready.

I often brew tea in my office, and there a a few coworkers who
like to taste a cup now and then, but they can't look through walls.

*teapot* serves a simple web page to display the current state of your teapot.
Status updates are done entirely manual via shell scripts.

*teapot* is not an implementation of RFC 2119 / 7168 (HTCPCP-TEA).
Neither does it contain functionality to control computerized
teap pots.
